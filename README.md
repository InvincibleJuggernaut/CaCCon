<h1>Introduction</h1>

This project models a 4-way set associative 16KB cache memory with PLRUt (Pseudo-Least Recently Used (tree variant)) based cache replacement
policy along with 8MB RAM. There is also a cache controller to manage memory access, coordinate cache hits and misses and implement the PLRUt eviction
logic.
